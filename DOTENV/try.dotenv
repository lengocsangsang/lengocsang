In a browser environment, you cannot use dotenv like you do in Node.js because .env files 
are not accessible in the frontend for security reasons.

🌟 Alternative Solutions to Use Environment Variables in the Browser
Since the browser doesn’t have access to the filesystem, here’s how you can manage environment variables 
safely:

✅ 1. Use a .env File with a Build Tool (Vite, Webpack, Parcel)
If you're using a build tool like Vite, Webpack, or Parcel, you can load environment variables 
into process.env at build time.

Example for Vite or Parcel
1️⃣ Create a .env file in your project root:

ini
Copy
Edit
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
2️⃣ Access it in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY;
console.log(apiKey); // Will print your API key
⚠️ Important: In Vite, all environment variables must start with VITE_ to be exposed to the client.

✅ 2. Store API Keys in window (Unsafe but Quick)
You can define your API key in the window object:

html
Copy
Edit
<script>
  window.API_KEY = "your_api_key_here";
</script>
Then access it in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const apiKey = window.API_KEY;
⚠️ Warning: Anyone can inspect this in the browser's DevTools.

✅ 3. Use a .json Config File (Safer than .env in Frontend)
1️⃣ Create a config.json file:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "apiKey": "your_api_key_here"
}
2️⃣ Load it dynamically in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy
Edit
fetch("config.json")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((config) => {
    const apiKey = config.apiKey;
    console.log(apiKey);
  });
🔹 Pros: The file is separate, and you can exclude it from version control.
🔹 Cons: Still exposed to the public in the frontend.

🚀 Best Practice
✅ If security is important, store secrets on the backend and expose only necessary data via an API.

✅ If you're using Vite, Webpack, or Parcel, use environment variables with build-time injection.

✅ If it's non-sensitive data, use a config file (config.json).
